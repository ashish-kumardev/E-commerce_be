# E-commerce backend api's

I have taken a challenge with vishwa mohan sir by pwskills in which they will teach us complete backend development in 21 days with hands on real world project. So, while learning this course I created this project which help me lot to understand about backend and their terms like : server, request and response between client and server, middlewares, controllers and so on. This is my first project in backend and I create so many api's while working on it like : signIn, signUp and perform different types of CRUD operations on API's.
